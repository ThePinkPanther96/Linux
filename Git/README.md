# Configure Git Server
## Introduction 
The purpose of this script is to define a complete Git server environment, including Git user (Git Admin),Repository, and ssh key, on CentOS 7.
Please note, I chose to use CentOS 7 for convenience purposes. However, the commands and attached scripts can be easily edited to adjust for different Linux distros.

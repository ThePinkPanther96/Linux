# Configure Git Server
## Introduction 
The purpose of this tutorial is to set up a comprehensive Git server environment, comprising a Git user, a repository, and SSH keys, on CentOS 7. Please note that I've chosen CentOS 7 for the sake of convenience. Nevertheless, the commands and accompanying scripts can be easily adapted for different Linux distributions.

## Requirements
- CentOS 7 environment
- Working networking connection with access to the internet.
- Basic understanding of Linux Bash.
- Remote client for testing (In my case I used Windows with Git Bash)
